# Housing_Price_Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project, based on Linear Regression.
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable (output) based on one or more input variables (features). There are many use cases of linear regression and 'Housing Price Prediction' is one of them.

The workflow of the model can be described as:
1. Collecting the appropriate data.
2. Pre-processing the data by handling missing values, normalizing the features and encoding categorical variables.
3. Training the model by using linear regression to learn the relationship between features and price.
4. Testing the model by evaluating its performance using metrics.
5. Input new house features to predict its price.
